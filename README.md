## Synopsis

[//]: # (At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.))

Scripts written in Bash to grade students' C++ programming assignments.
The scripts automatically grade and prints out a detailed report in PDF for
each student, detatiling where their code failed.

The scripts, aided with C++ test harnesses, test the OOP classes by first
injecting code (friending my test classes into their classes) into their
code and then testing each class member separately, allowing for partial
credit.

## Code Example

[//]: # (Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.)

Refer to the README file in the scr directory.

## Motivation

[//]: # (A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.)

Have the computer do the work for me.

## Installation

[//]: # (Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.)

TODO

## API Reference

[//]: # (Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.)

TODO

## Tests

[//]: # (Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.)

TODO

## Contributors

[//]: # (Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.)

TODO

## License

[//]: # (A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.))
